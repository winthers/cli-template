## Description

This is a template for creating node CLI apps.

### resources
- [ascii art generator](https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Bloody&t=name%20) we need cool looking banners.
- [colored console outputs  using chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk/v/4.1.2) we want colors
- [command line arguments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) we are lazy.


## Dependencies
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) | The application is build using node, and the node runtime is required on the system to use the CLI.


## Setup

When [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) has been installed on the system, we need to install all the packages that are dependencies in this project.

To install the dependencies, start a terminal in the root location of the project and run the following command (the installation process might take a while).

*note: only need to be installed one time, as its symlinked*

```terminal
npm i -g
```


## How to use the CLI

Assuming the installation and setup steps have been completed, we can now start using the CLI.

In a terminal run the following command:


```console
foo
```
